## twitterdata2feeder
this is a small bash script that creates a feeder.opml file from your [twitter data](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive), which you can then import into the [feeder app](https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/Feeder).

for this script to work you need the following things:
- the unzip package installed on your mashine 
    - for ubuntu/debian sudo apt install unzip
- a download of your [twitter data](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive) as "*.zip*"

also you will need to install the [feeder app](https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/Feeder) on your mobile phone. Without it this script is somewhat useless.
