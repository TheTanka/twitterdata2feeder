# twitterdata2feeder
this is a small bash script that creates a feeder.opml file from your twitter data, which you can then import into the feeder app.

for this script to work you need the following things:
- the unzip package installed on your mashine 
    - for ubuntu/debian sudo apt install unzip
- a download of your twitter data (.zip)

also you will need to install the feeder app on your mobile phone. Without it this script is somewhat useless.
